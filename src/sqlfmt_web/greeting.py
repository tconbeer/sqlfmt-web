# sqlfmt

sqlfmt formats your dbt SQL files so you don't have to. It is similar in nature to black, gofmt, and rustfmt (but for SQL).

When you use sqlfmt:

1.  You never have to mention (or argue about) code style in code reviews again
1.  You make it easier to collaborate and solicit contributions from new people
1.  You will be able to read your team's code as if you wrote it
1.  You can forget about formatting your code, and spend your time on business logic instead

## Installing sqlfmt

**tl;dr: `pip install shandy-sqlfmt[jinjafmt]`**

sqlfmt is a command-line tool that is built in Python and runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows. Visit the **[Github Repo](https://github.com/tconbeer/sqlfmt)** for more information on how to get started.
